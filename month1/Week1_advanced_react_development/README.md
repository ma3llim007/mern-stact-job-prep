# React Learning Journey

This README summarizes the focused learning effort over several days to enhance React skills and best practices:

## Day 1-2: React Performance Optimization

-   Learned techniques such as `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, and `React Profiler` to improve component rendering.
-   Implemented code-splitting using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for efficient resource loading.
-   Applied list virtualization and debouncing for handling large data sets.

## Day 3-4: State Management

-   Explored advanced Redux Toolkit features like Middleware, RTK Query, and Async Thunks.
-   Studied alternative state management libraries, including Zustand and Recoil, for simplified state handling.

## Day 5-6: React Concurrency

-   Investigated experimental features like Concurrent Mode and React Server Components.
-   Practiced using `Suspense` for data fetching to enhance app responsiveness and user experience.

## Day 7: Accessibility and Testing

-   Focused on Web Accessibility by leveraging ARIA roles and improving keyboard navigation.
-   Used Lighthouse to audit and optimize performance and accessibility.
-   Gained hands-on experience with Unit Testing (Jest) and Integration Testing (React Testing Library) to ensure code quality.

This structured approach provides a strong foundation for building efficient, scalable, and inclusive React applications.
