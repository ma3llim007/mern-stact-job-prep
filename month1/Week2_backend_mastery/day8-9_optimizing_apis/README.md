# API Best Practices: Pagination, Filtering, Sorting, Rate Limiting, and Throttling

This document outlines best practices for building scalable, performant, and secure APIs, focusing on essential features such as pagination, filtering, sorting, rate limiting, and request throttling.

## 1. API Pagination

### What is Pagination?
Pagination divides data into manageable chunks (pages), improving performance and usability.  
**Benefits:**
- Reduces server load.
- Improves response time for clients.

### How it Works
- Use query parameters like `?page=1&limit=10` to specify the page number and number of items per page.
- Retrieve a subset of data from the database based on these parameters.

### Key Concepts
- **Offset and Limit**: Common SQL-based pagination approach using `OFFSET` and `LIMIT`.  
  Example:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
  ```
- **Cursor-Based Pagination**: Uses unique identifiers (cursors) for better performance with large datasets.

## 2. API Filtering

### What is Filtering?
Filtering allows clients to retrieve specific subsets of data by applying conditions.

### How it Works
- Use query parameters like `?name=John&age=30` to specify filters.
- Dynamically build database queries based on these parameters.

### Best Practices
- Validate and sanitize query parameters to prevent SQL injection or malicious input.
- Avoid exposing sensitive fields in filtering options.

## 3. API Sorting

### What is Sorting?
Sorting organizes data based on a specific field, such as `?sort=age&order=asc`.

### How it Works
- Parse sorting fields from query parameters and dynamically modify the database query.

### Best Practices
- Allow sorting by multiple fields if necessary (e.g., `?sort=name,age`).
- Define default sorting to ensure consistent behavior when no sorting parameters are provided.

## 4. Rate Limiting

### What is Rate Limiting?
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client can make to the server within a defined time window.

### Why Use It?
- Prevents abuse such as DDoS attacks.
- Ensures fair usage of server resources.

### How it Works
- Use middleware like `express-rate-limit` in Express.js to enforce rate limiting.
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

  const limiter = rateLimit({
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
    max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  });

  app.use(limiter);
  ```

## 5. Request Throttling

### What is Request Throttling?
Request throttling controls the flow of requests to prevent overwhelming the server, similar to rate limiting.

### How it Works
- Use tools like Redis to maintain counters or queues for tracking and managing request flow.

### Best Practices
- Combine throttling with rate limiting for high-traffic APIs to ensure smooth performance.
- Provide informative responses (e.g., HTTP 429) when a client exceeds the allowed request rate.

## Summary

By implementing these practices, you can ensure your APIs are efficient, scalable, and secure:
- **Pagination** for handling large datasets.
- **Filtering** for retrieving relevant subsets of data.
- **Sorting** for organizing results.
- **Rate Limiting** and **Throttling** for protecting server resources and improving reliability.

Follow these guidelines to build robust APIs that meet modern web application requirements.
